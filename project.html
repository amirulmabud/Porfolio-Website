                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p class="summaryparagraph" > &emsp; The Kiosk based CCS Faculty Informaton System is a system that made for the faculty member
                    of College of Computer Studies at Mindanao State University - Sulu. This system is inteded to
                    improve the curent technical situation of mananging faculy members
                     information. 
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     
                     &emsp; Kiosk-based CCS Faculty Information System is an Information System for College of Computer Studies
                      Faculty Members, where the user will be able to find faculty members profile, including their educational
                       background, certificates and training, together with their schedule based on the teaching load and
                        consultation time. This system will add to the College of Computer Studies innovation process in
                         terms of getting in touch with the modern way of managing Faculty member’s information where the
                          information can be manageable and easily be accessible. 
                          <br><br>
                          &emsp;  Kiosk is one of the popular devices used as an information system/information kiosk by many 
                          institutions due to the number of advantages they provide. A Kiosk-based system displays information
                           and provides it through some form of interactive menu system.  Kiosk Technology is a computer
                            terminal specialized hardware and software that provide access to information and application
                             for communication, commerce, entertainment, or education. 
                             <br><br>
                             &emsp; The researchers used different methods and techniques in accomplishing this study, the study 
                             uses a form of software development life cycle model known as the waterfall model or waterfall 
                             methodology. It consists of requirement analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, 
                             and maintenance. The developers also used their personal experience as the methods and tools apply in 
                             gathering the Data and Requirements necessary in the fulfilment of the study.
                             <br><br>
                             &emsp; Since information is one of the most important assets of an organization and institutions, having a good
                             information system will lead to the development of full potential of its information resources in order
                              to achieve its goals and objectives.

                           &emsp; The former processes of managing faculty member information on CCS
                              can be time consuming for the Dean, College secretary, department chairperson, faculty, students and 
                              staff. This process used as a requirement analysis for developing the Kiosk-based CCS faculty information
                               system. A system that will be able to provide information in a minimal transaction and or processes but 
                               still deliver a reliable and credible information. 
                           This system is essentially a simple yet versatile system that both promotes a culture of transparency, and minimizes the time and 
                           effort required for student to know some information about their teacher, and for faculty members to build, 
                           maintain and showcase their professional profiles.

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <img src="waterfall.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="150"> 
                <p class="developmentparagraph"> &emsp; the study uses a form of software development life cycle model known as the Waterfall Model or Waterfall Methodology. Waterfall
                     Model also known as Linear-sequential life cycle model is a very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase
                      must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no 
                      overlapping in the phase (Tutorials point 2021)  .The developers also used their personal experience as the methods and tools apply in gathering the Data and
                       Requirements necessary in the fulfilment of the study.</p>
                <h3>Development and Testing</h3>
                <img src="htmlcss.jpeg" alt="" width="250" height="150"> 
                <p class="developmentparagraph"> &emsp; The development of the Kiosk-based CCS Faculty Information System was done with the use of 
                    the following software: PHP (PHP Hypertext Processor) where the main program are being coded, HTML (hypertext markup language)
                     used for front end of the system and can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and PHP, CSS
                      (Cascading Style Sheets) used for making the system more interactive and well design and also makes the system presentable 
                      to the user, Bootstrap for helping the HTML and CSS framework in developing a responsive kiosk-based project, and, XAMPP
                       used for testing the system in localhosts to be able to see the output of every code that they enter into the system, 
                       it’s also the database of the data that will be retrieve by the system. <br> <br>

                      <br>   &emsp;     The developers gave their full potential and effort upon developing this system.
                  Testing is one of the Phase of SDLC Waterfall Model after the system was being coded it undergo to testing to test if the
                   system meet the requirements, and it’s also being tested on the hardware of the system which is the kiosk, and after the
                    development of the system, dry run was be impose to know if the system is working efficiently and effectively, on intended platform. 
                    <br><br>
           <h3>System Dry Run</h3>
           <p class="dryrunparagraph">
            &emsp;   Dry run was conducted at Mindanao State University – Sulu College of Computer Studies, used by BSIT, BSCS Students and CCS Faculty Members.
               This is the Evaluation Tool or Test Document of Kiosk-Based CCS faculty information system. The Researcher construct a statement which is used 
               to test the experience of the respondents upon using the system on Kiosk. The researcher gives a statement and will
                be rated by the respondents from 1 to 5. And the researcher will determine the feedback from the respondents by evaluating the percentage of
                 statement that being rated by them.
